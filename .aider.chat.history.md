QuietLink
It is marketed as a simple link keeper that lets users save and sort web links in one organized place. A key claimed feature is the ability to bypass web blocks to access any site, while appearing as a normal work tool on the screen. It also offers quick switching between a "work view" and "free browse mode," requires no extra setup, and is designed to look inconspicuous in the task list. It is targeted at office workers, students, travelers, or anyone wanting private, unrestricted browsing. The app is listed as "coming soon" for Windows and Mac.
 
However, it’s important to note that the website quietlink.online (potentially related) has a low trust score on Scam adviser, with indicators like a young domain age and suspicious sites hosted on the same server. Use caution if considering this app, as its legitimacy and security have not been verified.

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this new file to describe the logo image that should be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized image of a chain link with a subtle shield overlay, representing secure link management. The link is depicted in a sleek, modern style with a gradient from deep blue to teal, set against a light gray background. The shield is semi-transparent and positioned behind the link, giving a sense of protection. The overall composition is clean and minimal, suitable for a logo that conveys privacy and organization.
